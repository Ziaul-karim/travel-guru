    "description": "For Bangladeshis it doesn't get much better than Cox's Bazar, the country's most popular beach resort. Sort of a Cancun of the east, it's choc-a-bloc with massive cement hotels and gaudy over-development catering largely to the country's elite. To a foreigner it likely won't compare to other beach vacations you may have taken, but it's still interesting to see how the Bangladeshi's live it up. The beach is crowded, especially near the Hotel Motel Zone, a large cluster of more upmarket hotels. Expect lots of attention, and expect to stay fully clothed. 30 km south is Inani Beach. Things should be quieter here, but still expect to draw some attention.You can also check out the Burmese Market, but don't expect a lot of handicrafts. The traditional Burmese dresses and fabrics are definitely interesting. Besides that, you will find some stores which sell pearl jewellery. You can also try some local beauty products (sandal wood based), hand woven textile and bedsheets among many other things.",

    "description": "Sundarban is the biggest mangrove forest in the world. Sundarban is in South West part of Bangladesh, in the district of greater Khulna. India shares a bit of the forest with Bangladesh. The total area is about 38,000 square kilo meters. Sundarban is a large block of littoral forests. The beauty lies in its unique natural surrounding. The Sundarbans are a part of the world's largest delta formed by the rivers Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna. Thousands of meandering streams, creeks, rivers and estuaries have enhanced its charm. For miles and miles, the lofty treetops form an unbroken canopy, while nearer the ground, works of high and ebb-tide marked on the soil and tree trunks and the many varieties of the natural mangrove forest have much to offer to an inquisitive visitor.",
